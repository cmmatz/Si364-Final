This is my podcast application: 
The application will ask a user to sign in with their username and password.  If the user does not have an account, they will have to make one.  
It will direct you to a page that asks you to search for new podcasts and the user can decide whether they want their podcast emailed to them. 
Once you search for a podcast, it will redirect you a list of podcasts within that name.  The podcast art and title will show up.  If you click on the name of the podcast it will direct you to a link of episodes.  You can click on the button at the top to add those episodes to "My List".  If you click on the name of the episode you will get a link to the video recording of the podcast. 
On the home screen, when you click on "My Subscriptions", you will get a link that takes you to a button that will load your past subscriptions.  
The database is: cmmatz_final
run in terminal: python final.py runserver
